# PWC Call Center Report
As part of my role in a PwC job simulation, I was tasked with assisting one of PwC's call center clients. The client sought actionable insights from their raw data to improve operational efficiency and identify growth opportunities. To address this, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing key metrics, trends, and KPIs such as customer satisfaction, agent performance, and call handling efficiency. This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for data-driven decision-making.
